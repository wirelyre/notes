# Law of No Serendipitous Travel Companions

There are walkers and joggers.  There are 10-kph bikers and 30-kph bikers.
There is everything in between, and beyond.  But you'll never meet a good one by
chance.

## Matching speeds

A perfect travel companion matches your speed.

Suppose every person has a preferred range of speeds.  If two people have
overlapping ranges, they can travel together!

As long as each person slows down a little (if possible) if they're pulling
ahead, or speeds up (if possible) if they're falling behind, they will naturally
negotiate speeds in their shared range.  It's a cooperative feedback loop with
no talking required.

("No talking required" is good for travel.)

I expect that this generalizes to a group of people, as long as each person
slows down or speeds up to try to match the centroid of the group.  There's
probably some math you could do on that.

## NnnnnnnrryooOOommmmm üèé

You encounter a lot of people going the opposite direction from you.  In fact:

- If your route and someone else's are continuous nonintersecting paths (no
  loops or reversing),
- and they intersect with each other,
- and you two are headed in opposite directions on the intersecting portion,
- and both of you are ever in the intersecting portion at the same time,
- then you are *guaranteed* to meet.

This is a consequence of the intermediate value theorem.

### Digression: Mean value theorem

My high school calculus teacher told us this and thought it was hilarious. (She
was right.)

Tollbooths mark down the time when you pass through them.  You might pass
through multiple tollbooths in a single trip.

Given the distance between two booths, and the time someone took to get from one
to the other, you can know something about the traveller's speed.  Specifically,
regardless of changing speeds, even of going backwards, at *some point* the
actual speed was exactly as fast as the "mean traveller" who goes at constant
speed.

So my calculus teacher thought they should issue speeding tickets that begin
with "_By the mean value theorem_".

## Let's go!

If you leave with a companion with whom you share a preferred speed range, you
can stay with them for the entire trip.

But if your speed ranges don't overlap, you'll slowly drift apart.  :-(

The more differenter your speeds, the faster you'll drift.  That means that the
best companions are closest to your speed (because you can hang out longer!) and
the worst are furthest from your speed (because you can't).

Assuming you like each other, anyway.  I guess better companions like each
other better too.

## (distant rumbling); The great irony of serendipitous travel

What's that in the distance?  It's someone going much slower than you ‚Äî and
you've passed them already.  Oops.

What's that rumbling sound behind you?  It's someone going much faster ‚Äî watch
out! ‚Äî and they're long gone.  Real fast though, good for them.

If you're going the same direction, then the further someone's speed is from
your own, the more likely one of you passes the other.  You'll meet for a brief,
precious moment; but it'll be short because you're not going the same speed at
all.

If someone's speed is *close* to yours, *if* one of you passes the other, you'll
be together for quite a long time.  That passing will be sweet and wonderful,
but it's unlikely to happen.  Because you started at different points, the
closer your speeds, the longer it takes to meet.

And that perfect companion?  The one who matches your speed perfectly?  Your
*soulmate*?

You'll be apart forever.

In delicious, beautiful irony, you two will remain a fixed distance apart, never
to know the other's existence.  Though you could stay together forever, you will
never encounter each other.  Every starting distance is too great; if you do not
begin together, you will never meet.

## Anyway

If you want a companion while you walk, run, bike, or caravan, you need to know
who they are in advance and you need to set off together.
